#City simulator

This is the code for our project for the [Distributed and Concurrent Systems][scd] course for the Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of Padova. The project designs and implements a distributed and scalable event-based city simulator in Scala. The user interface uses SVG, JavaScript and [D3].
